# Lecture 3 - News writing

_The structure of this lecture borrows heavily from the first link, to [Bill Park's Basic Newswriting write-up](http://www.ohlone.edu/people/bparks/docs/basicnewswriting.pdf). I am using it with Bill's blessing._

# ABCs: Accuracy, Brevity, Clarity

# Gatekeeper role

_"Write 10 percent of what you know"_

# Five Ws, in order of importance

* What
* Who
* Where
* When
* Why - Sometimes
* And "so what?"

# Newsworthiness

* Impact
* Proximity
* Timeliness
* Prominence/"celebrity"
* Novelty
* Conflict
* Relevance
* Usefulness
* Human interest

# Hard news, versus soft

# Objectivity and fairness

* Fairness in fact-gathering: Look for the other side
* Fairness in writing: Use neutral language
* Up for debate: "pro-life", "pro-choice", "pro-abortion" terminology
* Use your language, not your sources: "Officers found narcotics on his person"; "The fastest processor Apple ever put into a phone"

# Story structure: The upside-down pyramid

# The lead

# The nut-graph

# Quotes

"Quotes bring a story to life," Bill Parks said.

* Don't use them for information
* Don't use them "out of context"
* Minimize partial quotes

Good: "I won't run for president," Dan Quayle said Thursday. "But I may walk a little."
Bad: "When asked about his presidential plans," Quayle said he "won't run."

* Indirect quotes must convey accurately what the person said
* They may introduce direct quotes
* Make it clear who is speaking. Use transitions: "Meanwhile, another city councilman had opposite views."
* "Said" is good. Seriously. Don't look for synonyms, just write.

# Exercise - Writing against a deadline

Choose a brief press release from the [FBI newsroom](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel), such as [this one](Police reports - https://www.justice.gov/usao-ct/pr/shelton-man-admits-robbing-4-connecticut-banks). It should be short in order to finish the exercise in time.

This is the kind of press release that hits newsrooms big and small and unless they had a scoop -- advanced knowledge before their competition -- they will be scrambling to publish a story. 

Read the release and write a news story based on it, following the principles discussed in class. You might have follow-up questions, but for this exercise you won't be seeking answers. That doesn't excuse you from writing a fair and accurate story. Write it as if none of your sources called you back before your editor demanded a finished story. Think about how you could make the story better if you had more time.
