# Write with facts

__Example 1__ From ["Telling Writing", Ken Macrorie](https://www.amazon.com/Telling-Writing-Ken-Macrorie/dp/0867091533?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=ad-backfill-amzn-one-good-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0867091533):

     Instead of saying,

     	     _I found my trip to see my fiance was marvelous. Being with him
     	     was even more thrilling than I thought it would be. I think
     	     it's real love._

    give the reader the fact that drove you to that generalization.

    	     _He had a two-week leave after Basic, so I flew to Jersey and
    	     we stayed with his parents on the Shore. It was great being
    	     with him -- even when his whole family watched us watch
    	     television._

    Instead of trying to express how great, how small, how wonderful, how
    sad something is, establish its size or intensity with facts.

__Example 2__ From [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/10/09/fast-moving-wildfires-ravage-northern-californias-wine-country/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_no-name%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.1ef3dd08229a)

    Instead of,

    	  Fires devastated Northern California Monday, causing deaths,
    	  injuring many, and damaging property.

    you don't need to make the value judgment that the fires were
    "devastating" if you can describe their effects with facts:

	  Fires pushed by warm winds and fueled by dry ground swept through
	  California wine country Monday, killing at least 10 people,
	  injuring numerous others, and torching more than 2,000 homes and
	  businesses.

__Example 3__: From Catcher in the Rye, chapter 5

    Instead of,

   	   I sat around busying myself with various things while he got
   	   ready, which took a long time.

    Salinger writes,

   	    It took him about five hours to get ready. While he was doing
   	    it, I went over to my window and opened it and packed a
   	    snowball with my bare hands. The snow was very good for
   	    packing. I didn't throw it at anything, though. I started to
   	    throw it at a car that was parked across the street. But I
   	    changed my mind. The car looked so nice and white. Then I
   	    started to throw it at a hydrant, but that looked too nice and
   	    white, too. Finally I didn't throw it at anything. All I did
   	    was close the window and walk around the room with the
   	    snowball, packing it harder. A little while later, I still had
   	    it with me when I and Brossard and Ackley got on the bus. The
   	    bus driver opened the doors and made me throw it out. I told
   	    him I wasn't going to chuck it at anybody, but he wouldn't
   	    believe me. People never believe you.

   Salinger's words accomplish more than filling in the timeline of
   Holden's evening, they offer insight into his thoughts and feelings all
   through evidence. In this case, the "facts" include both the details of
   his account, but how he tells it. He starts the paragraph with a lie and
   then says no one believes "you," meaning him. The entire paragraph
   serves as a fact on its own, evidence that he is a so-called "unreliable
   narrator."

__In practice__ consider each sentence presents facts or adds necessary
framing. If not, cut it.

# Cliches, exaggeration and other canned language

* "Needless to say"
* "Everyone is fascinated by motorcycles"
* "Nothing compares with" such and such a hardship
* He spent two years as a camp counselor and "doesn't regret a minute of it"
* He is "about to embark on a new adventure in the real world"

__In practice__ write how you speak, but when editing, challenge yourself
to ask what you really meant to express. If that is worth saying, say
it. If not, cut it.

# Economy

"If the presence or absence of something has no discernible effect, it is
not part of the whole" -Aristotle

# Quick editing improvements

* Avoid overuse of the verb "to be" and your writing will ~~be more active~~ jump off the page
* Eliminate adverbs when a stronger verb will do

# Sparklines 

* Economical
* Densley packed information
