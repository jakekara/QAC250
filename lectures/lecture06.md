From ["Telling Writing", Ken Macrorie](https://www.amazon.com/Telling-Writing-Ken-Macrorie/dp/0867091533?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=ad-backfill-amzn-one-good-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0867091533):

     Instead of saying,

     	     _I found my trip to see my fiance was marvelous. Being with him
     	     was even more thrilling than I thought it would be. I think
     	     it's real love._

    give the reader the fact that drove you to that generalization.

    	     _He had a two-week leave after Basic, so I flew to Jersey and
    	     we stayed with his parents on the Shore. It was great being
    	     with him -- even when his whole family watched us watch
    	     television._

    Instead of trying to express how great, how small, how wonderful, how
    sad something is, establish its size or intensity with facts.

__In practice__ consider each sentence presents facts or adds necessary
framing. If not, cut it.

# Cliches, exaggeration and other canned language

* "Needless to say"
* "Everyone would be surprised to know
* "Nothing compares with" such and such a hardship
* He spent two years as a camp counselor and "doesn't regret a minute of it"
* He is "about to embark on a new adventure in the real world"

__In practice__ write how you speak, but when editing, challenge yourself
to ask what you really meant to express. If that is worth saying, say
it. If not, cut it.

# Economy

"If the presence or absence of something has no discernible effect, it is
not part of the whole" -Aristotle

# Quick editing improvements

* Avoid overuse of the verb "to be" and your writing will ~~be more active~~ jump off the page
* Eliminate adverbs when a stronger verb will do

# Sparklines 

* Economical
* Densley packed information
