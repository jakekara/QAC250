# Data for [How A Warm Winter Destroyed 85 Percent Of Georgia’s Peaches](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-warm-winter-destroyed-85-percent-of-georgias-peaches/)

Here's all the data from "How A Warm Winter Destroyed 85 Percent Of Georgia’s Peaches" by Ella Koeze of FiveThirtyEight, who was kind enough to point me toward all of it.

# Here's the data

1. Peach production from here: https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/56C4B89D-33E8-3C01-BB84-C1CDA393E735
2. Chill hours in peach county from here: http://agroclimate.org/tools/chill-hours-calculator/ (the station I used is the point just southeast of Macon, GA)
3. Map data from here: http://mrcc.isws.illinois.edu/gismaps/vipstndata.htm (you can download csvs here also, note that the September start map has restarted for the new year)

The map data comes in points for individual stations which then need to be interpolated. The csv I’ve attached is for Oct. 1 – Sept. 12.

Note, the attached CSV files are
