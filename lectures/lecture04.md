# Lecture 4 - Importing data from humans, a.k.a "interviewing"

_Any time you speak with someone for a story, that's an interview_

# Goals

* To find out and verify information
* To get quotes for your story

# Not goals

* To make source happy
* To promote your source's agenda

# Finding a subject

* Authoritative, enough
* Able to get you closer to your answers
* Willing and able to talk
* Don't be afraid to ask someone who they think you should speak with

# Getting someone to talk

* Cold-calling
* Tell them what you're working on, sometimes
* If they have reservations, ask about them
* If they are reluctant or might look bad in story, explain you want to include their point of view
* Make it clear you will do your story whether they comment or not
* Know when to back off
* Ask for a no-comment comment if all else

# Logistics

* Don't wait until the last minute
* Assume they will reschedule, phones won't work
* Assume you'll need to follow up with them after the interview
* Have a backup plan

# Preparation

* Study past interviews this subject has given
* Write specific questions in advance, noting which ones are musts for your story
* Anticipate what topics subject might be evasive on, and plan for that

# Good questions

* Reflect that you've prepared
* Avoid yes-or-no questions
* Do not lead or suggest an answer

# Note-taking

* Your notes are an important record, and protection
* Your editor may ask to see your notes
* Write down date, location of interview
* Write down your must-have questions
* Use a shorthand for direct quotes versus paraphrasing
* Ask source to repeat anything you didn't get; they should appreciate that you're trying to get it right
* At the end, doublecheck you have your must-have answers

# Recording

* Ask for permission
* Explain whether recording is to be published or just for note-taking
* Write down time of important quotes
* Still take notes

# Off the record and other terms

* On the record - Info, quotes are publishable, quotable, attributable
* Off the record - Not useable for publication
* On background - Useable on conditions negotiated with source, but you should avoid this
* Deep background - Useable without attribution, not even anonymously
* Regardless of the terminology, make sure you are in agreement

# Conducting the interview

_Modify these to suit your communication style_

* Do not provide your questions in advance
* Make the source feel comfortable; generally I chat before getting straight to it
* Let the source know what you're working on, why you're asking these questions
* I don't like the source to be able to read what I'm writing, so I write messy on purpose, and tip notepad toward myself
* I like to restate information back to the source in my own words, so I can make sure that I can describe it accurately in my story
* Let them talk, even if you won't be using that part of the interview
* Listen to their answers and have a conversation
* Don't fill the silence - let them do it - and don't step on their answers
* Respect their time
* Sometimes you have to ask a question you know a source won't answer, because that non-answer is still newsworthy
* Asky why they won't answer
* Ask if there's anything they want to ask that you didn't ask about
* Do not let the source take over your story

# Difficult questioning

* Personally challenging topics, such as substance abuse
* Question canned language that glosses over subjects

# Follow-up
* Writing will expose the gaps in your knowledge, and questions you forgot to ask or clarify
* Mention during interview you might need to follow up

# In-class exercise and homework


This will be a partnered exercise. You will have 20 minutes in class to interview each other -- spending 10-15 minutes as the interviewer and then 10-15 minutes as the subject. The homework portion will be writing up your interview as a brief, Story Corps-style vignette no longer than one page.

Pair up with someone you don't already know and introduce yourself. Find
out some basic biographical information about them such as basic
information their full name (that means correct spelling, too), their age,
where they're from, their major.

Next, pick a question to ask them for a Story Corps-like vignette. You can
find question ideas
[here](https://storycorps.me/question-generator/?view=best-questions), or
come up with your own. Below are a few from the Story Corps site that might
lead to good responses.

1. Tell me about your parents. What was your life like growing up?
2. How would you describe yourself to someone who has never met you?
3. What is something you are passionate about?
4. What advice would you give to your teenage self?
5. Of the people youâ€™ve lost in your life, who do you miss the most? What is it about them that you miss?
6. Can you tell me one of your happiest memories?


If they have trouble opening up, it's your job to help them get
started. Listen to their response carefully and ask questions show you are
engaged. Find details in their story and ask them to elaborate.

Exchange contact information in case you have follow-up questions when you go home and write.

__What to turn in:__ Write the story up, using rich, accurate quotes, in no
more than a page. I will be looking to see that you listened carefully and
got to the heart of your subject's story.
