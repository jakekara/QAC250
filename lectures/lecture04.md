# Lecture 4 - Importing data from humans, or interviewing

_Any time you speak with someone for a story, that's an interview, whether you're asking a simple question over email, or sitting down face-to-face for a human interest profile_

# Finding a subject

* Authoritative, enough
* Able to get you closer to your answers
* Willing and able to talk
* Don't be afraid to ask someone who they think you should speak with

# Getting someone to talk

* Tell them what you're working on
* If they are reluctant or might look bad in story, explain you want to include their point of view
* If they mistrust "the media," ask them to be more specific and how you can be more trustworthy
* Make it clear you will do your story whether they comment or not
* Know when to back off
* Ask for a no-comment comment

# Logistics

* Don't wait until the last minute
* Assume they will reschedule, phones won't work
* Assume you'll need to follow up with them after the interview
* Have a backup plan

# Preparation

* Study past interviews this subject has given

# Note-taking

* Your notes are an important record, and protection
* Your editor may ask to see your notes
* Write down date, location of interview
* Write down your must-have questions
* Use a shorthand for direct quotes versus paraphrasing
* Ask source to repeat anything you didn't get; they should appreciate that you're trying to get it right
* At the end, doublecheck you have your must-have answers

# Recording

* Ask for permission
* Explain whether recording is to be published or just for note-taking
* Write down time of important quotes
* Still take notes

# Off the record and other terms

* On the record - Info, quotes are publishable, quotable, attributable
* Off the record - Not useable for publication
* On background - Useable on conditions negotiated with source, but you should avoid this
* Deep background - Useable without attribution, not even anonymously
* Regardless of the terminology, make sure you are in agreement

# Conducting the interview

_Modify these to suit your communication style_

* Make the source feel comfortable; generally I chat before getting straight to it
* Let the source know what you're working on, why you're asking these questions
* I don't like the source to be able to read what I'm writing, so I write messy on purpose, and tip notepad toward myself
* I like to restate information back to the source in my own words, so I can make sure that I can describe it accurately in my story
* Let them talk, even if you won't be using that part of the interview
* Let them talk, do not lead or suggest an answer to your question
* Respect their time
* Ask if there's anything they want to ask that you didn't ask about

# Difficult questioning

* Personally challenging topics, such as substance abuse
* Question canned language that glosses over subjects

# Follow-up
* Writing will expose the gaps in your knowledge, and questions you forgot to ask or clarify
* Mention during interview you might need to follow up
