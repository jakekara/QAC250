# What is journalism?

# What are different types of journalism?

# The process of journalism

  * Where to start?
  * Fact-gathering
  * Storytelling - writing, illustration, photography, cinematography, visualization, interactivity
  * Components of news writing:
    * Structure
    * Spelling and grammar
    * Stylebook
    * Attribution
    * Accuracy/precision
    * "If your mother tells you she loves you, check it out"
	
# What do you want to know about a source?

  * Authority - Why should we believe this person? Street cred.?
  * Completeness - What questions can this person answer?

# Data are just like any source.

  * Authority - Why should we believe these data?
  * Completeness - What questions can these data answer?
  * "Interrogate it hard enough and it'll tell you anything you want to know."

# Data - singular or plural?
  
# What is data journalism?

#### "Big tent" definition

*Everything, since all journalists use data!*

#### More useful definition

*Journalism employing sophisticated techniques of obtaining, analyizing and presenting data*

May result in:
    
* Plain-text story, informed by analysis
* Visual components
* Interactives
* Databases and other "web apps"
